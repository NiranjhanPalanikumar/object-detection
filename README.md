# object-detection

This project was done with a code along tutorial on using tensorflow object detection API to detect different Hand Signs. Tensorflow and Tensorflow Object Detection modules were downloaded and installed separately.

Image data was first collected using webcameras of the different hand signs and were subsquently labelled accordingly. These data sets were used to train a model whic can then be used to recognise the hand signs in live streams.

An example of this is shown below:
